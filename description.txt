X Bar – Account Sidebar

Meet the streamlined way to hop between accounts on X. X Bar adds a sleek, always-on sidebar to every page on x.com so you can launch the profiles you care about with a single click.

Highlights:
- Quickly jump to profiles by clicking their avatar or handle.
- Arrange accounts with drag-and-drop from the built-in options page.
- Choose whether the sidebar lives on the left or right edge of the page.
- Toggle the entire experience on or off without uninstalling the extension.
- Prevent duplicate accounts automatically so the list stays tidy.
- New: Dark mode for comfortable low-light browsing.
- New: Multi-column layout to see more accounts at once.
- New: Choose whether to display the profile’s real name or @handle in the sidebar.

How it works:
1. Install the extension and open any page on x.com.
2. Add accounts from the options page using a handle, @handle, or full profile URL. X Bar fetches avatars and names automatically.
3. Reorder or remove accounts anytime. Changes sync instantly across every X tab.
4. Click an avatar in the sidebar to open that profile immediately in the current tab.

Permissions:
- Storage access keeps your account list, sidebar position, and toggle state on your device.
- Tabs permission simply reloads open X tabs when you change settings so the sidebar stays up to date.
- Requests to fxtwitter API are only used to fetch public profile details when you add an account.

Privacy:
All account data, preferences, and cached avatars remain on your device. X Bar never tracks browsing history or shares information with third parties.

Give your X workflow a boost—install X Bar today and keep every account within thumb’s reach.
